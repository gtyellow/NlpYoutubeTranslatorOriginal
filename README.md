# NlpYoutubeTranslatorOriginal
Proof of concept for google cloud provider (GCP) translation tools.  Translates a youtube clip to a different user provided langugae.

You will need to set up your own GCP account and point the program to the appropriate API's.  Instructions are in the code.  

Future iterations could try other provider's translation tools to improve speed and accuracy as well as attempting to match the cadence of the original speaker.
